# SamuraiGame

This is a sample for a fighting game project built based on a tutorial provided by [Chris Courses](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Yp2yz6-pwhQuPlIDV_mjA). 
Based on this tutorial the following game provides a base to build upon with two fighters, reactive healthbars and a 60 second timer. The game can also decide a winner
based on health and timer conditions.

The game can currently be accessed here => [link](https://samuraifight.netlify.app/)
